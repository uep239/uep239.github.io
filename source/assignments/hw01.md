# Homework Assignment 1

**Due:** Tuesday, February 23 at 11:59 pm EST\
**Total available points:** 120\
**Maximum points:** 100

## Working on the Command-Line

For this section, please complete the assignments as specified for your operating system. Windows users are expected to submit PowerShell (`.ps1`) scripts and macOS users should submit Bash scripts with the appropriate shebang operator (`#!/bin/bash`) on the first line. For extra credit, submit both a PowerShell script and a Bash script for each assignment. Windows users can use **Git Bash** (*Start > Git > Git Bash*) to test Bash scripts and macOS users are welcome to install [**PowerShell Core**](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/latest) if they would like to experiment with PowerShell scripts.

### A Simple Shell Script

````{tabbed} Windows
1. Create a file named `hello.ps1` into your assignment repository with the following contents:
    ```powershell
    echo "Hello, world!"
    ```
2. Using **Windows Terminal** (or any other PowerShell interface) navigate to your assignment repository and run the following command to execute the script:
    ```powershell
    .\hello.ps1
    ```
3. Confirm that the output is as you would expect:
    ```text
    Hello, world!
    ```
4. Remember to commit this file to your repository and push it to the server!
````
````{tabbed} macOS
1. Create a file named `hello` into your assignment repository with the following contents:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Hello, world!"
    ```
2. Using **Terminal** (or any other Bash interface) navigate to your assignment repository and run the following command to allow the script to be executed:
    ```bash
    chmod 755 hello
    ```
3. Now run the following command to execute the script:
    ```bash
    ./hello
    ```
4. Confirm that the output is as you would expect:
    ```text
    Hello, world!
    ```
5. Remember to commit this file to your repository and push it to the server!
````

### A More Advanced Shell Script
Create a PowerShell script called `kingarthur.ps1` or a Bash script called `kingarthur` that creates a directory called `holygrail` into whichever directory the script is run from. The contents and structure of the `holygrail` directory should be as follows:

```text
ðŸ“‚holygrail
 â”£ ðŸ“„question.txt
 â”£ ðŸ“„answer.txt
 â”— ðŸ“‚meta
    â”£ ðŸ“„dir.txt
    â”— ðŸ“„time.txt
```

The contents of the text files should be as follows:
- `question.txt` should contain `What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?`
- `answer.txt` should contain `What do you mean? An African or European swallow?`
- `dir.txt` should contain the **full path** of the created `holygrail` directory (not the `meta` directory) in any format
- `time.txt` should contain the date and time the script was executed in any format

Hints and suggestions:
- You might want to search the web for a command that gives you the current date and time, or just try some potnetial command names until you find one that works.
- If you are writing a Bash script, do not forget to include the the shebang operator (`#!/bin/bash`) and remember that you have to use `chmod 755` to allow the script to be executed in order to test it.

Extra credit:
- For an additional XX points, submit both a PowerShell and a Bash script.
- For an additional XX points, make sure the date and time in `time.txt` is in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` 24-hour format.


## Getting Started with Python

All Python programs should be submitted as `.py` files and work as described when executed using the `python filename.py` command.

### Hello World
Write a Python program called `hello.py` that outputs the following when executed:
```text
Hello, world!
```

### Mathematical Equations
Write a Python program called `equations.py` that outputs the results of the following mathematical equations. The results of the equations should be outputted in order, one per line.

$$
    (2^{89} + 5^{70})^2
$$
$$
    6 + \sqrt[4]{6 \times 5 + 12}
$$
$$
    \sqrt{16^2 + 43^2}
$$
$$
    \ln(e^{27} + 2^{30}) + \sin(\arccos(\pi \div 4))
$$

The result of the second equation should be `8.54572989502183`. Knowing this, your program should output something that resembles the following:
```text
-999
8.54572989502183
-999
-999
```

Obviously, `-999` should be replaced with the actual value of the corresponding equation. And no, you cannot just use `print(8.54572989502183)` for the second equation instead of typing it out in Python.

### Simple Calculator
Write a Python program called `calculator.py` that asks the user for two numbers $X$ and $Y$ and then outputs the following:

- $X + Y$
- $X - Y$
- $X \times Y$
- $X \div Y$
- $X ^ Y$

This is an example of what execution of your program should look like:
```text
Enter number X: 5
Enter number Y: 2
X + Y = 7
X - Y = 3
X * Y = 10
X / Y = 2.5
X ^ Y = 25
```

### Triangle
Modify the `triangle.py` script included in your assignment repository to ask the end user the length of the triangle side instead of using a predetermined number.

### Square
Create a Python program called `square.py` that asks the end user for their desired square side length and then uses `turtle` to draw a square with the specified side length. Feel free to use `triangle.py` as an inspiration.

### Another Square
Create a Python program called `shape.py` that asks the end user for a number and then constructs a square using `#` symbols with each side of the square consisting of the specified number of `#` symbols. Yor program is only expected to work with inputs that are positive integers greater than or equal to two (2).

Here are some examples of how your program should behave:
```text
Enter a number greater than or equal to two: 2
##
##
```
```text
Enter a number greater than or equal to two: 3
###
# #
###
```
```text
Enter a number greater than or equal to two: 7
#######
#     #
#     #
#     #
#     #
#     #
#######
```
You should not feel the need to use loops or anything like that. All you need for this is string arithmetic.

### Text in a Box
Write a Python program called `box.py` that draws a box around any input it takes. Here is what it should look like:
```text
Enter some text: test
+----+
|test|
+----+
```
```text
Enter some text: This is just a test.
+--------------------+
|This is just a test.|
+--------------------+
```

### Word Analyzer
Write a Python program `ratio.py` that asks the end user to input a word and then outputs the vowel to consonant ratio for said word. You can assume that all inputs will be single words composed using only the 26 letters of the English alphabet. While you can assume that the input will not contain any characters that are not letters, the letters themselves may be either uppercase or lowercase. The vowels of the English alphabet are `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, and `u`. All other letters are consonants. The vowel to consonant ratio for any word is the number of vowels in the word divided by the number of consonants.

Here are some examples of what execution of your program should look like:
```text
Enter a word: test
The vowel to consonant ratio for the word "test" is 0.3333333333333333
```
```text
Enter a word: Dog
The vowel to consonant ratio for the word "dog" is 0.5
```
```text
Enter a word: CODE
The vowel to consonant ratio for the word "code" is 1.0
```
```text
Enter a word: aMeBOa
The vowel to consonant ratio for the word "ameboa" is 2.0
```
