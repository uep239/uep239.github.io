# Homework Assignment 1

**Due:** Tuesday, February 23 at 11:59 pm EST\
**Total available points:** 120\
**Maximum points:** 100

## Working on the Command-Line

For this section, please complete the assignments as specified for your operating system. Windows users are expected to submit PowerShell (`.ps1`) scripts and macOS users should submit Bash scripts with the appropriate shebang operator (`#!/bin/bash`) on the first line. For extra credit, submit both a PowerShell script and a Bash script for each assignment. Windows users can use **Git Bash** (*Start > Git > Git Bash*) to test Bash scripts and macOS users are welcome to install [**PowerShell Core**](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/latest) if they would like to experiment with PowerShell scripts.

### A Simple Shell Script

````{tabbed} Windows
1. Create a file named `hello.ps1` into your assignment repository with the following contents:
    ```powershell
    echo "Hello, world!"
    ```
2. Using **Windows Terminal** (or any other PowerShell interface) navigate to your assignment repository and run the following command to execute the script:
    ```powershell
    .\hello.ps1
    ```
3. Confirm that the output is as you would expect:
    ```
    Hello, world!
    ```
4. Remember to commit this file to your repository and push it to the server!
````
````{tabbed} macOS
1. Create a file named `hello` into your assignment repository with the following contents:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Hello, world!"
    ```
2. Using **Terminal** (or any other Bash interface) navigate to your assignment repository and run the following command to allow the script to be executed:
    ```bash
    chmod 755 hello
    ```
3. Now run the following command to execute the script:
    ```bash
    ./hello
    ```
4. Confirm that the output is as you would expect:
    ```
    Hello, world!
    ```
5. Remember to commit this file to your repository and push it to the server!
````

### A More Advanced Shell Script
Create a PowerShell script called `kingarthur.ps1` or a Bash script called `kingarthur` that creates a directory called `holygrail` into whichever directory the script is run from. The contents and structure of the `holygrail` directory should be as follows:

```
ðŸ“‚holygrail
 â”£ ðŸ“„question.txt
 â”£ ðŸ“„answer.txt
 â”— ðŸ“‚meta
    â”£ ðŸ“„dir.txt
    â”— ðŸ“„time.txt
```

The contents of the text files should be as follows:
- `question.txt` should contain `What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?`
- `answer.txt` should contain `What do you mean? An African or European swallow?`
- `dir.txt` should contain the **full path** of the created `holygrail` directory (not the `meta` directory) in any format
- `time.txt` should contain the date and time the script was executed in any format

Hints and suggestions:
- You might want to search the web for a command that gives you the current date and time, or just try some potnetial command names until you find one that works.
- If you are writing a Bash script, do not forget to include the the shebang operator (`#!/bin/bash`) and remember that you have to use `chmod 755` to allow the script to be executed in order to test it.

Extra credit:
- For an additional XX points, submit both a PowerShell and a Bash script.
- For an additional XX points, make sure the date and time in `time.txt` is in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` 24-hour format.
