# Homework Assignment 2

**Due:** Wednesday, March 3 at 11:59 pm EST\
**Total available points:** TBA\
**Maximum points:** 100

As with the previous assignment, you should follow the **GitHub Classroom** link on [Canvas](https://canvas.tufts.edu/courses/27438/assignments) or [Piazza](https://piazza.com/tufts/spring2021/uep239/resources) to have an assignment repository generated for you. Then you should clone the assignment repository to your computer and do all work there. Keep track of your work using consistent commits and remember to push your work to the GitHub server to back it up.

## Personalized Greeting

Write a program `greeting.py` that asks the user for their name and then greets the users using the inputted name. Regardless of the capitalization of the input, the name displayed in the greeting should be properly capitalized (each part of the name should begin with a capital letter, followed by lowercase letters). In addition to working with a single word like a first name, your program should also work with and properly capitalize both multipart names (for example, first, middle and last) and hyphenated names. You can assume that the user always inputs something that resembles a name.

Here is an example of what execution of your program should look like:

```text
Please enter your name: uku-KASPAR uUUsTaLu
Greetings, Uku-Kaspar Uustalu!
```

## Text Analyzer

Write a program `analyzer.py` that accepts any string as input and outputs the counts of all characters present in the string in [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) sort order as follows:

```text
Enter some text: This is just a test.
' ': 4
'.': 1
'T': 1
'a': 1
'e': 1
'h': 1
'i': 2
'j': 1
's': 4
't': 3
'u': 1
```

## Reinventing Math

The `reinventing_math.py` file in your assignment repository contains the following function definitions:

- `add(x, y)` returns the equivalent of `x + y`
- `negate(x)` returns the equivalent of `-x`
- `subtract(x, y)` returns the equivalent of `x - y`
- `absolute(x)` returns the equivalent of `abs(x)`

Using **only** the aforementioned `add()`, `negate()` and `absolute()` functions along with loops and conditionals, add the following function definitions to the `reinventing_math.py` file:

- `multiply(x, y)` should return the equivalent of `x * y`
- `square(x)` should return the equivalent of `x ** 2`
- `power(x, y)` should return the equivalent of `math.floor(x ** y)`
- `divide(x, y)` should return the equivalent of `x // y`
- `modulo(x, y)` should return the equivalent of `abs(x) % abs(y)`

Feel free to define helper functions where appropriate and reference any previously defined functions in a function definition. Just note that you are not allowed to use standard Python arithmetic anywhere. All arithmetic must use only the `add()`, `negate()`, `subtract()`, and `absolute()` functions and their derivatives. Division and modulo by zero are not defined in Python and can be undefined in your functions, meaning they can behave however and return whatever when attempting to perform these operations. Note that `0 ** 0` is defined as `1` in Python, hence `power(0, 0)` should also return `1` (even though zero to the power of zero is actually undefined in formal mathematics).

You can assume all inputs to your functions will be integers (including positive integers, negative integers, and zero). When supplied with any other input (like a floating-point number or a string), your functions can behave unexpectedly and err.

You should thoroughly test your defined functions and ensure they behave exactly as their equivalent Python expressions. Include a file `testing_math.py` in your assignment repository that outlines your testing procedure. If you somehow automate your testing procedure, you will receive generous bonus points.
